# Light Email Parser
Flask app for getting possible malicious URLs inside attachments in EML files

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>I wanted a light tool to upload suspicious EML files and extract URLs from attachment to analyze them in case of a targetted attack. I decided to build it on docker just to make it more easier to deploy </p>

<h1> Usage </h1>

<p>You only have to run the following</p>
<p><strong>Docker compose build</strong></p>
<p><strong>Docker compose up -d</strong></p>


<h1>Disclaimer</h1>


<p> This is the version 1 on the tool, you will find a lot of mistakes but for now it serves to its purpose</p>
